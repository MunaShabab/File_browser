*I created the Form and tested it with the document I created
* it worked as it was supposed to
*I also tested it with leaving the file name textBox empty and entering an invalid file name
* I got error messages for empty file name and unable to find file
*I added the browseButton and the click event handler
* I tested the application with browsing for a file and also enetring a file name 
* I relized that I had to add code to clear the listBox very time the read the file button is clicked so I did that for both the 
fileReader and fileBrowser applications and tested it.
